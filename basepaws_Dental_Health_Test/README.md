Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 3/14/2019

I noticed that a report is now provided for my earlier [Whole Genome Sequencing](https://basepaws.com/products/whole-genome-sequencing) sample, which I have uploaded.

**basepaws (Dental Health Test, $69-$79 each, 4 samples, Order #31272)**:

[Website](https://basepaws.com/products/cat-dental-health-test?variant=39630212202693) says "BUY MORE, SAVE MORE", and I thought there was a discount for ordering 4 samples to be delivered over the source of the year.  However, I ordered 4 individual samples, since I wanted to test them at intervals that were essentially as close as my cat would allow.  The price was the same both ways ($276, with Memorial Day discount).  So, while not strictly untrue (if you save $10 on 1 sample, you will save $40 on 4 samples), there was not really a discount for purchasing in bulk on the day that I did so, and I think this has the potential to give the customer the wrong impression.  **However, as of 6/23/2021, I don't think I see that option, and this may not be an issue for new orders.**

All 4 kits arrived on 6/7/2021.

I collected the **1st sample** (ID 31201053202314) on **6/7/2021**.  Bastu mostly licked the foam collector, so hopefully that is OK (versus having more direct contact with her teeth).  The prior training helped keep her from running away, but he hasn't quite figured out what is earning her the treat afterwards.

I collected the **2nd sample** (ID 31201053201942) on **6/8/2021**.  Again, Bastu mostly licked the foam collector.

I collected the **3rd sample** (ID 31201053202280) on **6/9/2021**.  Again, Bastu mostly licking, but I think less than the previous days.  Towards the ends, I might have had something closer to the ideal interaciton in the mouth, but I then stopped to give a treat (and, hopefully, build off that later).

Accordingly, I have decided not to submit my *4th sample*.  Instead, I will try to use that for training, and maybe try again for the oral samples at a later date.  The actual collection tube will have the right shape, and I have already ordered baby oral cleaners (such as [here](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K4RDVH1)) for previous training.  So, if I can find a way to temporarily attach the oral cleaner to the collection device, I think I can have something steral that I can use for training.

I was able to download all 3 results on **7/9/2021**.
