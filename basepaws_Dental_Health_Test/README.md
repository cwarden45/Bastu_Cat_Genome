**basepaws (mouth swab, ~15x [Whole Genome Sequencing](https://basepaws.com/products/whole-genome-sequencing), with raw data as FASTQ+BAM+gVCF)**:

Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 3/14/2019

I noticed that a report is now provided for my earlier Whole Genome Sequencing sample, which I have uploaded.

**basepaws ([Dental Health Test](https://basepaws.com/products/cat-dental-health-test), $69-$79 each, 4 samples, Order #31272)**:

Samples were ordered on 5/30/2021.

All 4 kits arrived on 6/7/2021.

I collected the **1st sample** (ID 31201053202314) on **6/7/2021**.  Bastu mostly licked the foam collector, so hopefully that is OK (versus having more direct contact with her teeth).  The prior training helped keep her from running away, but he hasn't quite figured out what is earning her the treat afterwards.

I collected the **2nd sample** (ID 31201053201942) on **6/8/2021**.  Again, Bastu mostly licked the foam collector.

I collected the **3rd sample** (ID 31201053202280) on **6/9/2021**.  Again, Bastu mostly licking, but I think less than the previous days.  Towards the ends, I might have had something closer to the ideal interaciton in the mouth, but I then stopped to give a treat (and, hopefully, build off that later).

Accordingly, I have decided not to submit my *4th sample*.  Instead, I will try to use that for training, and maybe try again for the oral samples at a later date.  The actual collection tube will have the right shape, and I have already ordered baby oral cleaners (such as [here](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K4RDVH1)) for previous training.  So, if I can find a way to temporarily attach the oral cleaner to the collection device, I think I can have something steral that I can use for training.

I was able to download all 3 results on **7/9/2021**.

**basepaws ([Dental Health Test](https://basepaws.com/products/cat-dental-health-test), $59 each, 1 sample, Order #32719)**:

I ordered 1 additional sample that I hope to have a vet help me collect on 7/11/2021.

## Other Notes

As I collect more data, I will comment on the preprint ([Kao et al. 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.441192v1)).  Already, I think the company is supposed to declare a competing interest, because this relates to a product that they are be selling.  However, I am waiting to say more about the scientific details (and implications for individuals purchasing the test).
