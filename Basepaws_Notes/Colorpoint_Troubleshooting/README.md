This subfolder contains some information moved from the [Health_Trait_Markers](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/edit/master/Basepaws_Notes/Health_Trait_Markers) folder, along with some additional informaiton.

As still presented in that location, this is what I can see using information from Wisdom Panel as well as the RefSeq annotations from other species:

![Possible UCSC TYR footprint](UCSC-TYR.PNG "Possible UCSC TYR footprint")

![alignment of Basepaws data for region above](UCSC-TYR-IGV_screenshot.PNG "alignment of Basepaws data for region above")

In terms of more detailed information, along with additional files:

# felCat8 liftOver

I am currently not 100% sure if it is the full explanation, but the view for alignments in this region in felCat8 looks better:

# felCat6 BLAST hits

I think the alignment also looks good for felCat6:

This is based upon the BLAST results uploaded in this subfolder, with the code in `run_BLAST.sh`
