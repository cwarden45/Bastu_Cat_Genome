These files were provided to me by ***Hasan Alhaddad*** (one of the corresponding authors on the [Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0) paper).

So, to be clear, I **did not** create these files.  I am just passing them along because I thought they were necessary for re-analysis of the raw data.  If they are posted somewhere else, then I will link to that location (and probably only provided the re-formatted file that I use for my analysis).
