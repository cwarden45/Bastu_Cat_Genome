These files were provided to me by ***Hasan Alhaddad*** (one of the corresponding authors on the [Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0) paper).

So, to be clear, I **did not** create these files.  I am just passing them along because I thought they were necessary for re-analysis of the raw data.  If they are posted somewhere else, then I will link to that location (and probably only provided the re-formatted file that I use for my analysis).

***Hasan indicated this paper should be cited for the Eastern-Western divergence (which I described in the "Basepaws_Notes" section)***:

Kurushima JD, Lipinski MJ, Gandolfi B, Froenicke L, Grahn JC, Grahn RA, Lyons LA. **2013**. [Variation of cats under domestication: genetic assignment of domestic cats to breeds and worldwide random-bred populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594446/). *Anim Genet* 44: 311-324.

***And this paper should be used to describe the Persian / Western I ancestry***:

Filler S, Alhaddad H, Gandolfi B, Kurushima JD, Cortes A, Veit C, Lyons LA, Brem G. **2012.** [Selkirk Rex: Morphological and Genetic Characterization of a New Cat Breed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695623/). *Journal of Heredity* 103: 727-733.
