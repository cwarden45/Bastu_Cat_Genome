First, I should thank a basepaws staff member for pointing out that there is genotype data available in the supplemental materials for [Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0) (during a discussion at [CatCon](https://www.catconworldwide.com/)).

I don't think the ancestry information is available there, but I will follow-up to see if I either over-looked something (or if I can otherwise obtain that information).

In the meantime, the information in the paper is sufficent for some unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis.

I think the data is for felCat6, but I am seeing if there is something available for felCat9.  I noticed the felCat9 lift-over .chain files were only for [felCat5 and felCat8](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/felCat9/liftOver/), but I believe there is [archived felCat6 data](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Felis_catus/ARCHIVE/ANNOTATION_RELEASE.100/Assembled_chromosomes/seq/) available from NCBI.

I've also done some testing of down-sampling markers for the broadest level of human ancestry (which is kind of like the "Eastern" and "Western" cat ancestry), which you can see [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genes_for_Good/RFMix_ReAnalysis/Downsample_Test/README.md).

I noticed an earlier [basepaws blog post](https://www.basepaws.com/blog/new-basepaws-reports-announcement-136) which looked relatively good (in that the cat was >50% polycat).  However, that is often not what I see in the [Facebook discussion group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BasepawssadorsCatDNAClub), and I would expect that most cats should be polycats.  Nevertheless, that is the sort of thing that I am trying to look into.

It's a separate project, but there are also pictures of some of the "[trios](http://felinegenetics.missouri.edu/99lives/successfully-sequenced-cats)" from the 99 Lives project, to get an idea about the difference in physical appearance among highly-related but admixed cats.  In other words, I think "appearance" versus "relatedness/kinship" is kind of like "traits" versus "ancestry."
