First, I should thank a basepaws staff member for pointing out that there is genotype data available in the supplemental materials for [Gandolfi et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25438-0) (during a discussion at [CatCon](https://www.catconworldwide.com/))

I don't think the ancestry information is available there, but I will follow-up to see if I either over-looked something (or if I can otherwise obtain that information).

In the meantime, the information in the paper is sufficent for some unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis.

I've also done some testing of down-sampling markers for the broadest level of human ancestry (which is kind of like the "Eastern" and "Western" cat ancestry), which you can see [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genes_for_Good/RFMix_ReAnalysis/Downsample_Test/README.md).
