## [Fetch by The Dodo](https://www.fetchpet.com/) (9/5/2022-9/4/2023)

Purchased on 9/4/2022 for yearly cost of **$1,633.07**.  I also plan to renew my [Banfield Wellness Plan](https://www.banfield.com/products/optimum-wellness-plan/Cat-plans) (*Special Care*, for preventative medicine).

*Max Annual Payout*: $10,000

*Deductable*: $400

*Reimbursement Rate*: 80%

I was originally interested in *PetPlan*, but my understanding is that [this is currently Fetch by The Dodo](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/petplan-rebrands-to-fetch-by-the-dodo-397588.aspx).

My cat has a prescription dental diet, although [this FAQ](https://www.fetchpet.com/faqs/prescription-food-pet-insurance-coverage) indicates that the prescription diet is not covered.  Preventative measures like dental cleanings are also [not covered](https://www.fetchpet.com/faqs/dental-coverage).

## Selected Pet Insurance Research Notes

I have not purchased pet insurance before, and it is possible that I might try out different insurance plans for different years.  If so, I have collected some notes to potentially consider in the future.

For 2022, [Embrace](https://www.embracepetinsurance.com/) was tied for the top ranking by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/best-pet-insurance/)
 - I have AAA insurance for my car, and my understanding is that there is some amount of a connection between [Embrace and AAA](https://www.pawlicy.com/blog/aaa-pet-insurance/)?
 - Listed as being "*Best for Older Pets*" by [Money](https://money.com/best-pet-insurance/) (in 2022)
 - Also listed as "*Best Value Pet Insurance for Cats*" by [All About Cats](https://allaboutcats.com/best-pet-insurance-for-cats) (in 2022).  However, this insurance was ***not*** selected as the best option for older cats, and there was a warning about denying some claims (I believe on Yelp).

For 2022, [ASPCA Pet Insurance](https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/pet-insurance-plan) was top-ranked by [findinsurance.com](https://findinsurance.com/pet-insurance-cats).
 - I am also familiar with the ASPCA in other contexts.

There are also rankings from [U.S.News](https://www.usnews.com/insurance/pet-insurance), [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/guides/insurance/best-pet-insurance/), [Fund.com](https://www.fund.com/top/pet-insurance/cat/desk/), etc.

My understanding is that [Trupanion](https://trupanion.com/) will lock in the price if you start when your cat is a kitten (or younger cat), and Trupanion also directly pays the vet (instead of being reimbursed by insurance afterwards, as I understand it).
