I have uploaded a report from the [UC-Davis VGL](https://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/cat/), and I will update [basepaws](https://www.basepaws.com/) reports when they are available (and you can see more notes about basepaws in the [Basepaws_Notes subfolder](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/tree/master/Basepaws_Notes)).

I don't have any raw data for the UC-Davis VGL sample, but I do have an [earlier blog post for the report for another cat](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2013/01/stormys-feline-dna-test.html) (and I hope some of my re-analysis of the basepaws raw data will hopefully be able to make use of data from the lab that developed that test).

The UC-Davis VGL sample collection was a cytobrush.

I submitted two different samples for Bastu for basepaws.  The first was a hair sample, and the second was a swab.

I was sent the swab when I requested higher coverage sequencing data (or, more precisely, I asked about raw data, and I then learned more about the protocol and the option for raw data for higher coverage sequencing).

While I know that extra experiments are required for health / traits (as mentioned [this comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu1uXAsAI6J/?fbclid=IwAR3TgmQ-wVweKm9bmzZFVgP-6vJAjfq8jeEMALVuwQa_XvO4cxtmgJos9Uw) for basepaws, and [this blog post](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2019/08/low-coverage-sequencing-is-not.html) for human lcWGS analysis), the **$95** basepaws kit is meant to cover 0.5x sequencing.  So, I paid an additional **$1000** for 15x sequencing (as I understand it, for the 2nd sample).

I believe this is the time-line for sample collection / processing:

**UC-Davis VGL (Ancestry Test, $120)**:

Purchased Test on 11/16/2018

Sample Recieved on 11/27/2018

Recieved Report on 2/25/2018 (*~so, a little more than 3 months turn-around time*)

**basepaws (hair sample, $95, ~0.5x sequencing, possibly other types later?)**:

Purchased Test on 2/24/2019

Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 3/1/2019

*Update (6/22)*: I think there was confusion, but it was decided just to provide ~20x sequencing for my swab sample, so I should only be recieving one report).

**basepaws (mouth swab, $1000, ~15x sequencing, with raw data as FASTQ+BAM+gVCF)**:

Purchased Test on 3/7/2019

Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 3/14/2019

Learned data was available on 5/24/2019 (assuming this was in fact for the 2nd sample)

Data available from AWS S3 bucket on 6/13/2019

*Waiting to recieve Report*

I'm not sure if basepaws will implement automatic deposit into the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (with owner's permission).  However, I have re-uploaded my raw FASTQ files here:

basepaws 15x WGS Read1: https://storage.googleapis.com/bastu-cat-genome/HCWGS0003.23.HCWGS0003_1.fastq.gz
basepaws 15x WGS Read2: https://storage.googleapis.com/bastu-cat-genome/HCWGS0003.23.HCWGS0003_2.fastq.gz

I still have money left from my $300 Google Cloud credit, but I don't know how much the charge is for people to download from a public link.  However, that should be available in the immediate future.

Now, it looks like this is [officially available for $950](https://shop.basepaws.com/collections/all-products/products/whole-genome-sequencing), but they don't describe providing a report (which matches what I currently have.

**basepaws [Coach My Cat](https://shop.basepaws.com/collections/coach-my-cat/products/coach-my-cat-health-behavior-program) (on sale for $120, but will increase to $300?)**:

This should be a 12-week program, where I beleive 3 sessions are included for free.

I'm not sure how much genomic information will be considered (since I didn't get a regular kit).

*10/31/2019* - Started filling out information on-line ("Health and Wellness Assessment" and "Weekly Cat Journal")

*11/10/2019* - Completed 2 of 12 weeks on-line.  I encountered a couple issues with scheduling a live session, but it looks like they got fixed later (see *11/20/2019*).  Either way, I have no complaints about the timing of responses of the chats (with responses within ~24 hours).

*11/13/2019* - While there are currently still some bugs to work out (which might have also affected the live sessions), I really did like [Week 3](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1195781695925936128) in terms of having substantiative eductional content.

*11/20/2019* - The calendar issue has been fixed (you can schedule an earlier session, and hours are more reasonable).  I also went back to revise the *11/10/2019* comment.

I have some Data Science courses that I would like to complete first, but I noticed Coursera also had courses from the University of Edinburgh like "[The Truth About Cats and Dogs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cats-and-dogs?)", "[EDIVET: Do you have what it takes to be a veterinarian?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/becoming-a-veterinarian)", and "[Animal Behaviour and Welfare](https://www.coursera.org/learn/animal-welfare)".  However, those won't provide behavior advice for your own cat.

**basepaws (mouth swab, $129.00)**:

Purchased Test on 11/1/2019

Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 11/6/2019

In order to be able to simplify being able to get another report, I ordered another kit (and I waited to be charged the full new amount, to be fair).

If raw data is eventually provided, I am also extremely interested to see samples from the same cat in different batches (since, I would expect low-coverage WGS to be more prone to batch effects, even though I would guess the Amplicon-Seq health markers are mostly OK).

**MyCatDNA / Optimal Selection ($99)**:

Purchased Test on 10/31/2019

Activated Kit / Collected Sample on 11/4/2019

Recieved Report on 11/25/2019

I guess I will find out if the report is the same, but I started trying to order a [MyCatDNA](https://www.mycatdna.com/en/) test and I was informed that I had to purchase a test through [Optimal Selection](https://www.optimal-selection.com/optimal_selection_cats/) (since I was a US customer).

The e-mail receipt came from a "**wisdomhealth.com**" e-mail.  If I try to go to that address, I get re-directed to [https://www.wisdompanel.com/](https://www.wisdompanel.com/).  You can't actually order a cat DNA test on that website, but I think this might explain what was meant by "***Wisdom Panel for Cats***" on [this article](https://www.certapet.com/cat-dna-test/) (even though they didn't mention the UC-Davis VGL)
